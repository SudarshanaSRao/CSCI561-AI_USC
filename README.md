# CSCI561-AI_USC
Welcome to the repository containing all my assignments for the **Foundations of AI (CSCI-561)** course! Each assignment features code that takes an input text file, processes the data, and generates an output text file as the result.

## Assignments
- **Search Algorithms**: Implementations of search algorithms like BFS, DFS, A*, and others to solve problems involving pathfinding and state-space exploration.
- **Game Theory**: AI techniques to implement strategies in games (Go) and other decision-making models.
- **Reinforced Learning**: Code implementing machine learning models, markov decision processes, including decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, and clustering algorithms.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Implementing algorithms for text processing, such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and text classification.
